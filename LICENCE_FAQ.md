## Modifications and Adapted Material

### What counts as “Adapted Material”?
Adapted Material includes any work derived from the licensed software where the original material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or modified in a way that requires permission under copyright. This includes mods, patches, and other derivative works.

### Can I distribute modified versions of the software?
Yes, as long as your modifications **do not create a Substantially Similar Product**. You must also comply with attribution requirements and include the license text or a link to it.

### What is a “Substantially Similar Product”?
A Substantially Similar Product is any software that:

- Closely reproduces the structure, functionality, user interface, gameplay, feature set, or audiovisual identity of the licensed software, or
- Uses the software as a base and makes only minor changes like texture swaps or renaming.

Products that transform the software significantly or combine it into a broader, distinct project are **not considered substantially similar**.

### Can I create a derivative that changes only textures or colors?
No. Simple cosmetic changes are considered insufficient; such a derivative would qualify as a Substantially Similar Product and is prohibited from independent distribution.
